Image & Video Captioning System (Open-Source, No Proprietary APIs)

This project implements an image and video captioning system using open-source models only.
It fulfills all requirements specified in the internship assignment.

Features
- Image Captioning
  - Accepts any image (.jpg, .png, .jpeg)
  - Uses BLIP (Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base)
  - Generates a short natural-language caption
- Video Captioning
  - Extracts 3 key frames using OpenCV
  - Generates a caption for each frame
  - Combines them into a final video summary
  - No scene detection required
- No Proprietary APIs
  - No GPT, Claude, Gemini, or paid services
  - Entirely open-source + local PyTorch inference

Setup Instructions
1. Create Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv

Activate:

Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

Mac/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

2. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

How to Run Image Captioning
python caption_image.py samples/sample.jpg

Example output:

"A brown dog running in a grassy field."

How to Run Video Captioning
python caption_video.py samples/video.mp4

Example output:

FRAME CAPTIONS:
- A car driving up a mountain road.
- A wide scenic view of hills.
- A vehicle continuing across the hillside.

FINAL VIDEO CAPTION:
A car driving up a mountain road. A wide scenic view of hills. A vehicle continuing across the hillside.

Models Used
BLIP — Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base

Reason for choosing:

- Lightweight
- Works well on CPU
- Fast inference
- High-quality general captions
- Completely open-source
